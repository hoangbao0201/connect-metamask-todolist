# Metamask-Connected ToDo List with Player Management

This project is a Next.js application that integrates with Metamask for authentication and includes a comprehensive To-Do List interface for managing players. The app allows users to add, edit, delete, and view player information, which is stored locally using `localStorage`.

- **Connect Metamask**: Led by [Nguyễn Hoàng Bảo](https://github.com/hoangbao0201) in the `connect-metamask` branch, this feature enables users to connect their Metamask wallet to authenticate and access the application.

- **Create Player**: Implemented by [Nguyễn Văn Duy](https://github.com/DuyNguyen555) in the `create-player` branch, this feature allows users to create new player entries.

- **Show Player**: Developed by [Trịnh Thế Nhật](https://github.com/TheNhatJS) in the `show-player` branch, this functionality displays a list of all players.

- **Edit Player**: Built by [Trình Xuân Lộc](https://github.com/TXLoc-30) in the `edit-player` branch, this feature allows users to edit existing player information.

- **Delete Player**: Created by [Hồ Công Thành](https://github.com/ThanhHo2205) in the `delete-player` branch, this function enables users to delete specific players from the list.
